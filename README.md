# Image Classification with Transfer Learning: VGG16  

This repository demonstrates how to classify images using transfer learning with the **VGG16** pre-trained model in TensorFlow and Keras. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of VGG16, which has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tune it for a custom image classification task.

## Features  
- **Transfer Learning**: Uses the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset as a feature extractor.  
- **Custom Dataset**: Fine-tunes the model on a custom dataset for image classification.  
- **Flexible Architecture**: Adds fully connected layers on top of VGG16 for task-specific predictions.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix

## Workflow  

### 1. Dataset Preparation  
- Load a dataset of images (e.g., cats vs. dogs, flowers, or a custom dataset).  
- Preprocess images:  
  - Resize images to the input size of VGG16 (224x224 pixels).  
  - Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].  
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets.  

### 2. Model Architecture  
- Load the **VGG16 model** with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.  
- Freeze the convolutional base to retain pre-trained features.  
- Add custom dense layers:  
  ```python
  model = Sequential([
      vgg16_base,
      Flatten(),
      Dense(256, activation='relu'),
      Dropout(0.5),
      Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
  ])
  ```  

### 3. Training  
- Compile the model with a suitable optimizer and loss function:  
  ```python
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```  
- Train the model on the training set and validate on the validation set.  

### 4. Evaluation  
- Evaluate the trained model on the test set to calculate performance metrics.  
- Generate a confusion matrix and classification report.  

### 5. Visualizations  
- Plot training/validation loss and accuracy curves.  
- Visualize predictions on test images.
