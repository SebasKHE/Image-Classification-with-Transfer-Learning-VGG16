# Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-VGG16
This repository demonstrates how to classify images using transfer learning with the VGG16 pre-trained model in TensorFlow and Keras. Transfer learning allows us to leverage the powerful feature extraction capabilities of VGG16, which has been trained on the ImageNet dataset, and fine-tune it for a custom image classification task.
